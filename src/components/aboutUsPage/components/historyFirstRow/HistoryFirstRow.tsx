          The Rajendra Prasad Institute of Communication and Management: A

        <p>
          Established in 1961 as Bhavanâ€™s College of Journalism, Advertising,
          and Printing, this flagship institute of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has
          evolved into a sprawling network offering journalism, communication,
          media education, and management courses across India. Renamed in 1965
          to honor Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Indias first President and a BVB
          founder, it set the standard for professional education. In 1978, it
          expanded to include management education, leading to its present name.
